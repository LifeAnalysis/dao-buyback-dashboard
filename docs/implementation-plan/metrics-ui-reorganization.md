# Metrics UI Reorganization

## Background and Motivation

The user requested to reorganize the existing metrics display (Buyback Value, Protocol Revenue, Tokens Bought) and time period selectors (1D, 7D, 30D, 90D, 1Y) using best UI/UX principles. Currently, these elements are scattered across different dashboard components without a unified design approach.

## Branch Name
`feature/metrics-ui-reorganization`

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current State Issues:
1. Metrics are displayed inconsistently across different dashboard components
2. Time period selectors lack visual hierarchy and clear grouping
3. No unified design system for displaying financial metrics
4. Poor mobile responsiveness for metric displays

### UI/UX Best Practices to Implement:
1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Primary metrics should be most prominent, secondary metrics grouped logically
2. **Consistent Design Language**: Unified styling, spacing, and typography
3. **Information Grouping**: Related data should be visually grouped together
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show most important info first, details on demand
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
6. **Accessibility**: Proper contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
