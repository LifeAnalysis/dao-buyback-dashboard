# Aave Buyback Data Integration

## Background and Motivation
The user wants to scrape real Aave buyback data from https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/buybacks and replace the current mock data implementation. This will provide accurate, real-time Aave treasury metrics to enhance the dashboard's value proposition.

## Branch Name
`feature/aave-buyback-integration`

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The TokenLogic page appears to load data dynamically via JavaScript/API calls
- Need to identify the actual API endpoints being called by the TokenLogic frontend
- Must maintain the existing caching and performance architecture
- Ensure data format compatibility with existing dashboard components
- Handle potential rate limiting and error scenarios gracefully

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Feature Branch and Setup
- [ ] Create feature branch `feature/aave-buyback-integration`
- [ ] Commit current changes to avoid conflicts
- **Success Criteria**: Clean feature branch created and ready for development

### Task 2: Investigate TokenLogic Data Source
- [ ] Analyze the TokenLogic website's network requests to identify API endpoints
- [ ] Document the data structure and available metrics
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for the new data format
- **Success Criteria**: API endpoints identified and data structure documented

### Task 3: Implement Aave Data Service
- [ ] Create dedicated Aave service for fetching buyback data
- [ ] Replace mock data in existing getAaveMetrics() method
- [ ] Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Success Criteria**: Real Aave data successfully fetched and cached

### Task 4: Update Dashboard Components
- [ ] Ensure all dashboard components work with new data structure
- [ ] Add any new metrics fields that are available from TokenLogic
- [ ] Test all dashboard variants (OptimizedDashboard, HybridDashboard, etc.)
- **Success Criteria**: All dashboards display real Aave data correctly

### Task 5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test data refresh cycles and caching behavior
- [ ] Validate error handling scenarios
- [ ] Ensure performance metrics remain optimal
- **Success Criteria**: System works reliably with real data and maintains performance
