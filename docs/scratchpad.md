# Treasury Dashboard - Scratchpad

## Current Active Tasks

### ðŸš€ Aave Buyback Data Integration
- **Status**: âœ… Completed & Optimized  
- **Implementation Plan**: [aave-buyback-scraper.md](implementation-plan/aave-buyback-scraper.md)
- **Started**: 2025-01-27
- **Completed**: 2025-01-27
- **Goal**: Replace mock Aave data with real buyback data from TokenLogic
- **Optimization**: Streamlined data fetching to essential chart metrics only

### ðŸ§¹ Codebase Cleanup and Refactoring
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Implementation Plan**: [codebase-cleanup.md](implementation-plan/codebase-cleanup.md)
- **Started**: 2025-01-27
- **Completed**: 2025-01-27
- **Goal**: Clean up redundant components, consolidate services, improve maintainability and documentation
- **Result**: Removed 3,908 lines of dead code, consolidated 13 unused components, enhanced documentation

## Lessons Learned

- [2025-01-27] The TokenLogic Aave buybacks page at https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/buybacks contains comprehensive buyback metrics that need to be scraped and integrated
- [2025-01-27] Current Aave implementation uses mock data in dataService.ts that needs to be replaced with real API calls
- [2025-01-27] Massive codebase cleanups can remove thousands of lines of dead code - always analyze component usage before assuming they're needed
- [2025-01-27] Consolidating similar services (dataService + optimizedDataService) into one well-architected service improves maintainability dramatically
- [2025-01-27] Comprehensive documentation during cleanup pays dividends for future developers and maintenance
- [2025-01-27] Single source of truth pattern in React state management reduces complexity and improves debugging
- [2025-01-27] âœ… OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED: Streamlined Aave data scraper to only fetch essential data needed for charts, removing comprehensive metrics display from landing page. Eliminated chart points (136 points) and transaction history (50 transactions) generation, focusing only on core buyback metrics needed for chart integration. Reduced data footprint while maintaining chart functionality.

## Quick Notes

- Project uses optimized data service architecture with caching
- Multiple dashboard components need to support new Aave buyback data
- Need to maintain existing performance optimizations while adding real data
